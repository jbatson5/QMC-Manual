.. _sCI:

Selected Configuration Interaction
==================================

A direct path towards improving the accuracy of a QMC calculation is
through a better trial wavefunction.  Although using a multireference
wavefunction can be straightforward in theory, in actual practice
methods such as CASSCF are not always intuitive and often require
being an expert in either the method or the code generating the
wavefunction.  An alternative is to use a selected configuration of
interaction method (selected CI) such as CIPSI (configuration
interaction using a perturbative selection done iteratively). This
provides a direct route to systematically improving the wavefunction.
